# Text-to-SQL Chatbot

A sleek, intuitive chatbot that bridges the gap between natural language and your database—transforming everyday English questions into accurate SQL queries and returning results effortlessly.

---

## &#x20;Why This Project Shines

* **Conversational, not code-y**: Talk to your database like you would a person—no SQL expertise required.
* **Plug-and-play**: Just configure your database connection and start asking questions. It handles the rest.
* **Versatile support**: Works with popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
* **Modular design**: Built with clear separation between LLM handling, SQL generation, and execution—easy to customize or extend.
* **Interview-ready clarity**: Showcase your grasp of RAG, LangChain-style agents, embeddings, and prompt engineering.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakankshamourya/Text-to-SQL-Chatbot.git
   cd Text-to-SQL-Chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your environment**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://user:password@hostname:port/dbname
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the chatbot**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Input**: You ask a question in plain English like, “Show top 5 customers by revenue.”
2. **LLM Prompting**: The system uses prompt engineering—along with schema awareness—to craft safe, correct SQL.
3. **Query Execution**: That SQL runs against your connected database.
4. **Answer Generation**: Results are parsed and transformed into user-friendly responses, possibly with a human-like summary or insights.

## Behind the Scenes: Key Components

| Component        | Purpose                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prompt Templates | Shape how your LLM translates natural language into valid SQL commands.         |
| Schema Awareness | Fetches table and column names to reduce ambiguity and errors.                  |
| SQL Execution    | Runs safely—watch for SQL injection and guard against unsafe queries.           |
| Result Parser    | Converts raw SQL output into readable, conversational summaries.                |
| Modular Layers   | Each module (LLM, parsing, execution) is cleanly separated for customizability. |

## Interview Talking Points

* **Why it matters**: Demonstrates real-world value—making data entry and exploration accessible to non-technical users.
* **Design decisions**: Discuss how prompt optimization, schema embedding, and retrieval-augmented contexts improve reliability.
* **Error handling**: Explain how you ensure generated SQL is valid, safe, and aligned with user intent.
* **Scalability & extensibility**: Emphasize how it could integrate vector stores for fuzzy retrieval (RAG), connect to other LLMs, or evolve into a graph-based system.
* **Ethical handling**: Mention measures taken to avoid exposing private data via prompts or improper query generation.

---

## Optional Enhancements (Talking Points)

* **RAG integration**: Use embeddings to retrieve relevant schema segments, documentation, or past queries as context.
* **Multi-database support**: Easily swap in Aurora, BigQuery, Snowflake, or others—thanks to abstraction layers.
* **Interactive UI**: Wrap with Streamlit, Flask, or React for a polished front end.
* **Security layers**: Add query whitelisting, sandboxing, or read-only fallback mode.

## Contribution & License

* **Contribute**: Ideas and improvements welcome! Think better prompt strategies, expanded database support, or UI enhancements.
* **License**: \[Specify license—e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.]

---

### TL;DR for Your Interview

* **What it is**: A user-friendly NLP interface to query databases using natural language.
* **Why it's impressive**: Seamless integration of LLMs with schema awareness and modular architecture.
* **Talk like a pro**: Emphasize prompt engineering, safe SQL generation, extensibility, and potential to scale with RAG or multimodal interfaces.
